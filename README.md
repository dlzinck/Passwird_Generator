#RandomPassword Generator Homework
This is a homework assignment to create a random password generator that can use special, lower case, upper case, and numerical characters using javascript. 

This code took me multiple attempts of trial and error. I've spent over 20 hours on this alone and still don't quite understand everything that is needed BUT I am starting to understand little by little. I used multiple references from multiple websites like w3schools, Stack Overflow, and MDN to name a few.

I made the mistake of not pushing my work up as I worked on the assignment after multiple attempts at trying to make a working code. I got carried away with research and trying to fix the old code and then make a new repeatedly. I will try my best to remember to push my work as I am producing and not at the end to leave a better trail.
