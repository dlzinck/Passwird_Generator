# Password Generator

## Description
 The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

When I click the button to generate a password I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. When prompted for password criteria then I select which criteria to include in the password. When prompted for the length of the password I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. When asked for character types to include in the password I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I answer each prompt my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. When all prompts are answered a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. When the password is generated the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
